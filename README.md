## Description

Almoçaí is a meal management software that aims to reduce food waste. The tool is accessible both to students, who must confirm that they are going to have lunch at the institution, and to servers who work in the kitchen, who, based on the data obtained, must produce an amount of meals that satisfies the students who have confirmed the use of the food, enabling conscious planning of available resources.

## How it works?

The student, being pre-registered, will be able to enter his food preferences, such as veganism or vegetarianism, once specified, they will be saved in the database. If the student has any type of allergy, contact the nutritionist. The student will have access to the menu offered during the week and thus, every day, until 10 am, he must confirm whether he will have lunch in the cafeteria or not, so the quantity of meals produced will be proportional to the confirmation of the students.
